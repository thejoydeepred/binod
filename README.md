**Strategic Development in Key Logistics Hubs**

The Netherlands is a critical logistics hotspot due to its proximity to major ports like Rotterdam and Antwerp, excellent transport infrastructure, and access to key European markets. Prologis has strategically focused on developing and acquiring logistics facilities in prime locations such as Tilburg, Oosterhout, and Almere, which offer excellent connectivity via motorways like the A27, A58, and A261, as well as proximity to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. For instance, Prologis Park Tilburg has become a flagship project, with a 260,000-square-meter distribution center, including a significant build-to-suit (BTS) extension of 37,000 square meters for Coolblue, a major online retailer in the Benelux region. This development, completed in 2017, underscores Prologis’ ability to deliver tailored solutions for e-commerce giants, a sector driving significant demand in the Netherlands.

Prologis employs a combination of speculative and build-to-suit development strategies. Speculative development allows the company to anticipate market needs in high-demand areas, while BTS projects, such as those for Coolblue and another retailer at Park Weststad in Oosterhout, enable customized facilities that meet specific operational requirements. These developments align with the Netherlands’ growing demand for modern, high-throughput distribution centers, particularly for last-mile delivery, fueled by the rise of e-commerce. The company’s focus on multi-market and Last Touch® distribution hubs ensures efficient delivery to dense urban populations, enhancing supply chain efficiency.

**Commitment to Sustainability**

Sustainability is a cornerstone of Prologis’ strategy in the Netherlands, reflecting both market trends and regulatory pressures for eco-friendly construction. The company has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2040, with its 2025 goal of carbon-neutral construction validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In the Netherlands, Prologis integrates sustainable design principles into its developments, adhering to certifications like BREEAM and WELL. For example, Prologis Park Venlo DC8 achieved BREEAM-Very Good certification, incorporating low-carbon building materials and circular design principles to reduce embodied carbon.

Innovative energy solutions are also a key focus. Prologis has implemented solar energy projects, such as the 1.2 MWp solar installation at its Bleiswijk distribution center in partnership with Dynalogic. This system powers warehouse operations and supports electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, contributing to the Netherlands’ energy transition goals. Additionally, Prologis Park Eindhoven DC4 exemplifies a new generation of warehouses designed for low-carbon logistics, incorporating energy-efficient systems and sustainable materials. The company aims to source 25-30% of building materials locally to reduce transportation emissions and uses recycled content to minimize environmental impact. These initiatives align with the Netherlands’ push for sustainable urban development and the real estate market’s projected growth to USD 329.3 million by 2030, driven by demand for environmentally friendly properties.

**Emerging Innovations in Logistics Real Estate**

Prologis is at the forefront of integrating technology and innovation into its logistics facilities to enhance operational efficiency and customer value. The company’s Essentials platform, launched in 2018, extends beyond traditional real estate to offer solutions like solar power, EV charging infrastructure, and logistics tech equipment. In the Netherlands, this platform supports customers in optimizing warehouse operations, particularly for e-commerce and third-party logistics providers (3PLs), which are increasingly adopting automation to scale productivity. Prologis’ partnership with technology providers like TestFit, which uses AI-driven solutions for site planningliteral:1⁊, and Cargomatic, a logistics platform, further enhances its ability to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

Prologis also leverages its in-house research team to provide data-driven insights, such as the Industrial Business Indicator and Prologis Logistics Rent Index, to anticipate market trends. In the Netherlands, where logistics real estate rents declined by 5% in 2024 due to market normalization, Prologis uses these insights to strategically position its facilities in high-barrier-to-entry markets, ensuring long-term value for investors and customers. The company’s focus on modular buildings and innovations in building materials further enhances the efficiency and adaptability of its warehouses, meeting the Netherlands’ demand for flexible, future-proof facilities.

**Key Developments and Market Impact**

Prologis’ developments in the Netherlands have had a significant economic and social impact. The company’s logistics parks employ nearly 1.1 million workers globally, with a substantial portion in the Netherlands, contributing to job creation and economic development. Projects like Prologis Park Tilburg and Almere DC5 not only support major retailers but also foster community engagement through initiatives like fundraising for the Stelvio for Life Foundation, which supports cancer research.

The Netherland real estate market benefits from Prologis’ focus on infrastructure development and mixed-use projects, which enhance urban accessibility and walkability. The company’s strategic acquisitions, such as the 2011 merger with AMB Property Corporation and subsequent expansions, have solidified its position as the largest industrial real estate company globally, with over 6,000 buildings and 1.3 billion square feet across 20 countries as of 2025. In the Netherlands, Prologis’ portfolio continues to grow, driven by strong leasing activity, with a 96.7% occupancy rate in 2016 and record contract signings for 3.5 million square meters in the same year.
